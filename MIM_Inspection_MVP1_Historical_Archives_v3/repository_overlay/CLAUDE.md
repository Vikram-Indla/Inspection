# MIM Inspection Platform - Project Authority

## Mission
Build the MVP1 Inspection Platform exactly from the versioned product contract. Do not rediscover, reinterpret, weaken, or expand scope without documented change control.

## Source of truth
Read these files in order at every session start:
1. `product-contract/00_START_HERE.md`
2. `product-contract/CURRENT_STATE.md`
3. `product-contract/GATE_STATUS.md`
4. `product-contract/execution/CURRENT_SLICE.yaml`
5. `product-contract/execution/TASK_ROUTER.yaml`
6. `product-contract/governance/OPEN_DECISIONS.yaml`
7. The task-specific files listed in the current slice.

## Hard rules
- Broad implementation is blocked until G8 is PASS.
- The 478 source requirements remain mandatory MVP1.
- A Phase 2 AI note defers only that AI sub-capability, never its parent requirement.
- Never invent policy values, providers, thresholds, SLAs, legal rules, risk weights, geofence values, retention, or Arabic scope.
- Never mark a page or component complete without runtime behavior, data, audit, negative paths, tests, and evidence.
- Never mutate workflow status directly; use canonical transitions and guards.
- Never edit an immutable submitted version.
- Never silently overwrite offline/server conflicts.
- Never replace an unavailable integration with a permanent mock and claim completion.
- Never remove or weaken an accepted requirement, field, rule, permission, state, audit event, offline behavior, or usability outcome.
- Do not push, merge, or modify `main` without explicit human approval.
- Do not edit frozen product-contract artifacts without an approved change-control task.

## Work protocol
Before work:
- State the task ID, process IDs, requirement IDs, acceptance IDs, screens, engines, dependencies, open decisions, and do-not-touch areas.
- Confirm the current Git branch and working tree.
- Stop if the current task conflicts with the product contract.

During work:
- Implement the smallest coherent vertical slice.
- Keep IDs in code, tests, evidence, and session records.
- Record every approved assumption in the decision register.

Before completion:
- Run required tests and negative paths.
- Capture the evidence named in the current slice.
- Update `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `SESSION_LEDGER.json`, `WORK_QUEUE.yaml`, and acceptance/evidence records.
- Do not declare completion while any required P0/P1 criterion is failed or unevidenced.

## Memory policy
- Git-backed files are authoritative.
- Obsidian is a human interface over the same repository, not a separate copy.
- Claude auto memory is advisory only and may never override the product contract.
- `CLAUDE.local.md` is personal and must not contain shared scope decisions.

## Design policy
- Figma golden screens and tokens become authoritative only after G6 approval.
- Mobbin is for pattern research and provenance, never direct copying.
- The iPad is a field application, not a reduced web portal.
- Admin engines are control planes, not simple CRUD screens.

## Gate position
G0 PASS. G1 CONDITIONAL PASS because the repository is empty. G2 PASS. G3 PASS. G4 is being established. G5-G8 are not passed. Broad build remains blocked.
